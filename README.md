# Rain
A simple weather app whose main purpose is to send notification at a user-given time if the following day has a forecast of rain. Also displays current weather conditions and temperature.

## Goal
This project was worked on and completed on Summer of 2018. The main purpose of this project was to introduce myself into app development.

## Details

This app displays current weather conditions and temperature and includes a timestamp of when the information was last updated.

Uses OpenWeatherMap’s API to make a HTTP request and obtain current weather data, based on user’s current latitude and longitude coordinates (asks for permission to access the phone’s current location).

Implemented an additional feature where Rain will run in background at a user-specified time and send a notificaiton to the phone if tomorrow has a forecast of rain.
